# CNN-for-Heart-Disease-prediction
Heart Disease prediction using a Convolutional Neural Network
- Cleveland heart disease dataset used
- pre-processed dataset
- applied various machine learning algorithms
- made a new CNN model
- trained and tested all models
- further compared results of my CNN model with models of some published research papers usinf evaluation metrics
